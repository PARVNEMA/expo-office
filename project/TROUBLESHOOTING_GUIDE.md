## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Email must contain @ symbol"
**Solution**: Make sure you have at least one `@` in the email field. No need for complex email format.

### Issue: "Cannot join game: session is not active"
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure an admin has started the game session
2. Check that the game has minimum 2 players
3. Verify RLS policies were applied correctly

### Issue: "Only administrators can start game sessions"
**Solutions**:
1. Verify user has admin role: `SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'user@email.com';`
2. Update user role: `UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'user@email.com';`

### Issue: "User must be authenticated to join games"
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure user is logged in
2. Check if session is still valid
3. Try logging out and back in

### Issue: Registration works but no session
**Solutions**:
1. Disable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings
2. Run: `UPDATE auth.users SET email_confirmed_at = NOW() WHERE email_confirmed_at IS NULL;`
